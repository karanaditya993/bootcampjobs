# bootcampjobs
Phase 3 Final Project- 
* Mike Farr
* Henry Vega 
* James Newman
* Karan Aditya

##The Problem
As a job searcher I have to signup, configure and daily monitor several job listing sites, otherwise I risk missing job opportunities I qualify for.  If my situation, skillset, or requirements change I must update all the different sites.

###The Solution
DBC Jobs is a job-searching engine that will scrape different websites (i.e. "Indeed", "glassdoor"), accessing their information to curate a list of potential jobs in full-stack, rails-based web development in the SF Bay area.

##User Stories - MVP.  As a user I want to...
* ...be able to see all my job listings at one site
* ...be able to see appropriate job listings for a DBC graduate immediately without configuration
* ...be able to add new skills to my profile and be shown additional jobs that I'm now qualified for.
* ...have my job listing sorted most recent first
* ...have jobs that are a better match for me appear before lessor matches

* ...have a "single page", simple, fast experience.* 
* ...authenticate with GitHub since my peers and I all have Git Hub

##User Stories - Stretch.  As a user I want to...
* ...receive an email with my customized job listing every morning
* ...Reviews of companies, interview styles by DBC students and alumni
* ...check job postings via smartphone
* ...respond to job postings from my phone
* ...Integrate with existing DBC career software
* ...track "Applied to", "Already taken"



Next we the teamates checked in with each other.  What are our priorities and heart felt goals for the project.
###Goals for Boot Jobs
1. Mike-- Make something that our friends can use by the end of this week
2. Hank -- Stay mindful about how everyone is doing during this hard week.
3. Karan- Be professional, hold yourself accountable for being here on time, finishing tasks on time
4. James- Stretch our limits, push ourselves, have an MVP product by the end
 
We agreed to standup morning, noon, and night with each other.  We will pair program on everything.
